I'm a joint undergraduate and master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus on AI. I'm interested in foundation model training, efficiency, and alignment. 

Currently, I'm working on pretraining large-scale foundation models in the Stanford SNAP group under Prof. Jure Leskovec. 

Previously, I worked on text-to-image model alignment as a Research Engineering Intern at Adobe Firefly and language model reasoning, evaluation, and alignment as an Intern of Technical Staff at Cohere. I've also built high-impact engineering tools as a Software Engineering Intern at Amazon and Oracle.
