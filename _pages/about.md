I'm a joint undergraduate and master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus on AI. I'm interested in foundation model training, efficiency, and alignment. 

Currently, I'm working in the CoCo Lab under Prof. Noah Goodman on efficient distillation of reasoning traces.

<!-- by exploring Early Readout mechanisms, using Reinforcement Learning to decide how many layers to compute for each token and the optimal number of chain of thought steps before answering. -->

Previously, I pretrained large-scale foundation models in the Stanford SNAP group under Prof. Jure Leskovec. I trained reward models and aligned text-to-image model diffusion generation this past summer as a Research Engineering Intern at Adobe Firefly. Before that, I worked on language model reasoning, evaluation, and alignment as an Intern of Technical Staff at Cohere. I've also built high-impact engineering tools as a Software Engineering Intern at Amazon and Oracle.
